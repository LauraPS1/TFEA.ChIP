CHANGES IN VERSION 1.19.2
------------------------

## New Features
- Added a **meta-analysis function** to combine results across datasets.
- Introduced a new **wrapper function** that performs the full enrichment workflow
in one step, reducing manual intervention.

## Enhancements
- Refactored and optimized several core functions for improved performance.
- Improved plotting functions for clearer and more customizable visualizations.

## Data Updates
- Updated the ChIPDB object using newly available regulatory region-to-gene annotations 
from the ENCODE rE2G method and CREdb, enhancing the biological relevance and accuracy 
of TF-gene associations.
- Integrated new datasets from **ReMap**.

## New default database:
- The TF-gene database bundled with TFEA.ChIP was built using the ReMap 2022 ChIP-seq 
collection and regulatory links from the ENCODE rE2G method. Due to memory constraints, 
the internal database includes only a subset of the 8,000+ available ChIP-seq 
experiments. Specifically, we selected 926 experiments performed in the ENCODE Projectâ€™s
Common Cell Types, prioritizing broadly representative and high-quality datasets.
