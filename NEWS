CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5
------------------------


New Features:

	* Integrate enrichment analysis results by TF with rankTFs().
	  The function uses the output of getCMstats() to perform
	  Wilcoxon rank-sum test or GSEA on the ChIPs ordered by
	  distance score.

New default database:
	* The TF-Gene database included with TFEA.ChIP was built using ReMap's
	  ChIP-seq collection (v. 2018) and GeneHancer's Double Elite regulatory
	  regions (v. 4.8). Because of memory limits, the internal database included
	  in TFEA.ChIP only stores ChIP-gene information from the 1060 ChIP-seqs
	  from the ENCODE project included in ReMap 2018.
	  To download the full database, as well as other ready-to-use databases
	  generated for TFEA.ChIP, visit:
