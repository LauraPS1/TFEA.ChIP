CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.1
------------------------

New ChIP-Gene databases available:

    * Using ReMap2022 collections for human and mouse.
    * Adding cell specific regulatory regions predicted with 
    ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction (doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0538-0).

New Features:

	* New database format (older databases are still compatible). The format
	consist of a list containing two elements:
      - Gene Keys: vector of gene IDs
      - ChIP Targets: list of vectors, one per ChIP-seq experiment, 
        containing the putative targets assigned. Each target is coded as
        its position in the vector 'Gene Keys'.
    * Database generation has been streamlined by joining together the
      functions GR2tfbs_db() and makeTFBSmatrix() into one, makeChIPGeneDB().

New default database:
	* The TF-Gene database included with TFEA.ChIP was built using ReMap's
	  ChIP-seq collection (v. 2022) and GeneHancer's Double Elite regulatory
	  regions (v. 4.8). Because of memory limits, the internal database included
	  in TFEA.ChIP can only store a fraction of the 8000+ ChIP-seq experiments in
	  the colection. We selected the 926 ChIP-seq experiments done in ENCODE
	  Project's Common Cell Types.
